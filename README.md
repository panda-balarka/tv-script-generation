## Generate TV Scripts
Introduction

In this project, generation of Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs from previous scripts is achieved. A part of the Simpsons dataset of from 27 seasons is used. The Neural Network will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

The project involves the use of embeddings to obtain contectual similarity, lower dimensionality and map words to numbers together with a lookup table.
Hyperparameter optimization is additionally used.
